> A framework for parallelizing dependent tasks

__Author:__ [Jeremy Coyle](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle)

---

## What's `delayed`?

`delayed` is an R package that provides a framework for parallelizing dependent
tasks in an efficient manner. It brings to R a subset of the
functionality implemented in Python's [Dask
library](https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/). For details on how best to use
`delayed`, please consult the package
[documentation](https://nhejazi.github.io/delayed/) and
[vignette](https://nhejazi.github.io/delayed/articles/delayed.html)
online, or do so from within [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

---

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("delayed")
```

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tlverse/delayed")
```

---

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/tlverse/delayed/issues).

## Example

This minimal example shows how to use `delayed` to handle dependent computations
via chaining of tasks:

```{r delay_fun_chain}
library(delayed)

# delay a function that does a bit of math
mapfun <- function(x, y) {(x + y) / (x - y)}
delayed_mapfun <- delayed_fun(mapfun)

set.seed(14765)
library(future)
plan(multicore, workers = 2)
const <- 7

# re-define the delayed object from above
delayed_norm <- delayed(rnorm(n = const))
delayed_pois <- delayed(rpois(n = const, lambda = const))
chained_norm_pois <- delayed_mapfun(delayed_norm, delayed_pois)

# compute it using the future plan (multicore with 2 cores)
chained_norm_pois$compute(nworkers = 2, verbose = TRUE)
```

_Remark:_ In the above, the delayed computation is carried out in parallel using
the framework offered by the excellent [`future`
package](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) and its associated
ecosystem.
