Description: Mechanisms to parallelize dependent tasks in a manner that
    optimizes the compute resources available. It provides access to "delayed"
    computations, which may be parallelized using futures. It is, to an extent,
    a facsimile of the 'Dask' library (<https://dask.org/>), for the 'Python'
    language.
